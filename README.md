<a href="http://www.tharangai.com"><b>Tharangai</b></a> is a personal project to create a set of alphabet characters for the Tamil Language which can be used for phonetic representation and computing. The project was born out of a desire to create British and American style crosswords in Tamil. Since Tamil had an abugida script with an alphasyllary, it was difficult to create such symmetric crosswords. So initially an attempt was made to split the alphasyllable into its constituent vowel and consonant. However this was wieldy and cumbersome and still did not serve the purpose.<br><br>

Hence modifications were made to the script and it was made completely different though similar to the Tamil script. This script is for sopecial use cases only and is not meant to replace the Tamil script. I call the script that was created as <a href="http://www.mtamil.com"><b>Menthamizh</b></a> script, since it can have application in Tamil computing.<br><br>

Some of the applications of the new script are computing, since fixed width fonts are possible with the script, easy Braille notations for Tamil speakers, word games, phonetic representation of foreign words etc.<br><br>

There are exactly 32 letters in the script - 10 vowels, 18 consonants and 4 modifiers which have their diacritic forms as well.<br><br>

Another side project is <a href="http://www.ptamil.com"><b>Pillaithamizh</b></a> which is simplication of Tamil grammar that will be taught using Menthamizh script so that it willl quick and easy to learn as well as to transition to Tamil later.<br><br>
